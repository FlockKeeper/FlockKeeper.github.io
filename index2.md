				<h2>Our New Service</h2>

				<p>Flock Keeper is intended to be an all-in-one solution for church, charity, and non-profit organization management. We are reaching out to our community of potential users well before development begins to see what features would be most valuable to those users.</p>

				<p>While we will have to charge a premium for some services, our intent is to offer many features at little or no cost for smaller organizations. Your feedback will help us prioritize our development efforts and determine a fair pricing scheme.</p>

Scott Carthel Escue @carth3l

Scott Escue has worked as a software developer for over 14 years. He thrives on learning new
tools and technologies, and he loves finding new approaches to solving problems.

Scott has been developing in Java for over 12 years on projects large
and small. It's his bread and butter, having worked with most of the
technologies in the Java EE stack and surrounding
ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. 

Scott is well versed with building web 
applications and the technologies that support the same - HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript (which, of course, implies a healthy disdain for IE). 
He enjoys using "new fangled" libraries and tools to build responsive, 
cross-browser UIs. 

Scott has been dabbling in Ruby and Rails development for over 5 years.
He uses Rails exclusively for all the web applications he builds outside 
his full time gig. He hasn't had the opportunity to work with Rails full time, 
so he makes no claims of mastery. But, he loves the sense of productivity that 
Rails affords when solving complex problems.

Scott started his career building Oracle client-server applications, and
has worked with Oracle databases in varying capacities ever since. He has also
worked with a number of other databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
several other lighter options such as Apache Derby and H2. Scott strives to
build ANSI compliant SQL and vendor-neutral data integration to the greatest extent
possible.

He Lives with his family in Alabama.

Joseph Barrett Hall @groundh0g

Joe Hall has been a professional software developer for nearly 25 years. 

He worked as a programmer for Microsoft and IBM and he was the software architect 
for a Fortune 500 bank. He was the CTO of a ticket sales and servicing company 
and he started his own consulting company in 2006. 

Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for 
businesses and governmental agencies, but game programming is his passion, and 
it was gaming that got him into programming in the first place. 

He was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio .NET team 
just after the Xbox was released in 2001. Joe is the author of XNA Game Studio 
Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360, which was published in 2007. 

Joe also dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see his 
artistic creations, you'll understand why he makes his living as a programmer. 

He Lives with his family in Alabama.

Team Sq&mu;all

With a combined experience of nearly four decades, Scott and Joe have been churning out 
great apps for businesses and governmental agencies. Now, they're looking for a place to
focus their copious free time.
